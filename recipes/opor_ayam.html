    <h2>Descriptions</h2>
    <p>
      Opor ayam is an Indonesian chicken dish originating from the central to Eastern parts of the
      Java islands. This is usually served to enliven Ramadan in our tradition, along with ketupat
      and sambal goreng kentang (chile-fried potato).

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 (2 to 3 pound) chicken, cut into 8 pieces</li>
      <li>1 lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>4 candlenuts</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground coriander</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
      <li>7 shallots, peeled</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped galangal</li>
      <li>½ tablespoon chopped ginger</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon white peppercorns</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon chopped fresh turmeric root</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
      <li>2 stalks lemongrass, bruised</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon tamarind juice</li>
      <li>5 makrut lime leaves</li>
      <li>3 bay leaves</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
      <li>3 ⅓ cups thin coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 cup thick coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 small bunch Thai basil (Optional)</li>
      <li>1 (2.8 ounce) package fried shallots</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Soak chicken pieces in lemon juice for 30 minutes.</li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, heat a dry skillet over medium heat. Toast candlenuts, coriander, and cumin in
        the skillet until fragrant, about 1 minute. Transfer to a large mortar and pestle and grind
        into a paste with shallots, garlic, galangal, ginger, peppercorns, and turmeric. Work in
        batches if necessary.
      </li>
      <li>
        Heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add spice paste and stir until aromatic, 2 to
        3 minutes. Add lemongrass, tamarind juice, lime leaves, bay leaves, salt, and sugar.
      </li>
      <li>
        Rinse lemon juice off chicken pieces and slide them into the skillet. Turn to coat evenly
        with spices. Pour in thin and thick coconut milk. Simmer until flavors combine, about 30
        minutes. Add basil leaves. Continue cooking until chicken is tender, about 15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>Serve chicken and sauce in a bowl, sprinkled with fried shallots.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
    <p>
      Substitute salam leaves for the bay leaves if desired. Use lime basil leaves if you can find
      them.
