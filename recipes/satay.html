    <ul>
      <li>½ cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>1 clove garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 ½ teaspoons brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
      <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
      <li>¾ pound skinless, boneless chicken breast halves - cut into 1 inch strips</li>
      <li>10 (6 inch) wooden skewers, or as needed, soaked in water for 30 minutes</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Peanut Sauce:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 cup coconut milk</li>
      <li>¾ cup chicken stock</li>
      <li>½ cup creamy peanut butter</li>
      <li>¼ cup brown sugar</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon curry powder</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons lime or lemon juice</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon soy sauce</li>
      <li>salt to taste</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Make the chicken: Whisk coconut milk, garlic, brown sugar, curry powder, salt, and pepper
        together in a large glass or ceramic bowl. Add chicken and toss to evenly coat. Cover the
        bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours.
      </li>
      <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
      <li>
        Remove chicken from marinade and shake off excess. Thread marinated chicken onto skewers;
        discard remaining marinade.
      </li>
      <li>
        Make the peanut sauce: Whisk coconut milk, chicken stock, peanut butter, brown sugar, and
        curry powder together in a saucepan over medium-high heat until simmering. Reduce the heat
        and simmer, whisking constantly, until smooth and thickened, about 5 minutes. Remove from
        the heat and stir in lime juice, soy sauce, and salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the sauce is coming to a simmer, cook chicken skewers on the preheated grill until no
        longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 4 to 5 minutes per side. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).
      </li>
      <li>Serve skewers with warm peanut sauce.</li>
    </ol>
